ðŸ›  Description:
This project is a web application that features a dynamic form with built-in validation using regular expressions (RegEx). The form ensures that users input data correctly by detecting and highlighting errors in real-time, providing an intuitive and user-friendly experience.

ðŸŒŸ Features:

Real-Time Validation: Form fields are validated as the user types, reducing submission errors.
RegEx-Powered Validation: Validates input for common fields such as:
Email addresses
Name
Surnames
IBA
Credit Card
BirthDay
Passwords (with strength requirements)
Phone numbers
Postal codes
Error Handling: Displays error messages dynamically next to invalid fields with clear instructions for correction.
Submission Control: Prevents form submission until all fields pass validation.
Responsive Design: Ensures the form is accessible and functional across various devices.
ðŸ›  Technologies Used:

Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Validation Logic: JavaScript and RegEx for dynamic input validation
ðŸ’¡ Why This Project?
This project demonstrates my ability to enhance user experience by integrating robust input validation mechanisms. It showcases my knowledge of regular expressions, real-time feedback design, and effective error handling in web development.
