🛠 Description:
This project is a web application that simulates the process of reserving airplane seats. Users can interact with a visual seating layout, select their desired seats, and experience a simplified version of a real-world reservation system. The project focuses on delivering an intuitive and engaging user interface while managing seat availability dynamically.

🌟 Features:

Interactive Seat Selection: Users can click on available seats to reserve them and see their status update in real-time.
Dynamic Seat Status: The application visually distinguishes between available, selected, and already reserved seats.
Class Options: Simulates different airplane seating classes (e.g., Economy, Business, First Class), each with unique layouts.
Reservation Summary: Displays a summary of selected seats, including seat numbers and total cost.
Persistent Reservations: Reserved seats remain saved when the user returns to the application (optional feature using localStorage).
🛠 Technologies Used:

Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Logic Handling: JavaScript for seat selection and status updates
