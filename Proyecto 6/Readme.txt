🛠 Description:
This project is a dynamic and interactive virtual keyboard designed to simulate the functionality of a physical keyboard within a web application. The keyboard is fully responsive and provides users with a seamless typing experience directly on their screen, making it ideal for accessibility or specialized input scenarios.

🌟 Features:

Fully Functional Keyboard: Includes all standard keys, such as letters, numbers, and special characters.
Shift Key Functionality: Allows users to toggle between uppercase and lowercase letters dynamically.
Responsive Design: Adjusts the layout and size of the keyboard based on the user’s screen size for optimal usability.
Real-Time Input: Inputs typed on the virtual keyboard are displayed in a connected text field instantly.
User Interaction: Key presses are visually highlighted to mimic the tactile feedback of a physical keyboard.

🛠 Technologies Used:
Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Logic Handling: JavaScript for key press functionality, shift toggle, and real-time text updates
